File Operations In Python & Error Handling
==================================================================
Python provides several built-in functions for file handling:
- open(): Used to open a file and return a file object
- read(): Method to read content from a file
- write(): Method to write content to a file
- close(): Method to close an opened file
The with statement is preferred as it automatically closes the file.

Error Handling in File Operations
Common exceptions when working with files:
- FileNotFoundError: When the specified file doesn't exist
- PermissionError: When you don't have rights to access the file
Always use try-except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.
This ensures your program doesn't crash unexpectedly and provides helpful error messages to users.
